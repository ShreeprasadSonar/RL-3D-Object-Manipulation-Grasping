## Overview

This repository contains code, simulation setup scripts, training procedures, and experiment results aimed at developing a robust and adaptable robotic grasping system. The main emphasis lies in integrating state-of-the-art RL algorithms like Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) to train the system.

## Project Highlights

- Integration of DQN and DDPG algorithms for adaptive grasping strategies
- Utilization of PyBullet simulation framework for testing and evaluation
- Detailed evaluation metrics including Success Ratio and training iterations
- Performance comparison between DQN and DDPG in grasping accuracy
- References to related research articles and literature in RL-based robotic manipulation
